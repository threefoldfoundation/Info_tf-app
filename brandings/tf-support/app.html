    We have created a new ticketing system, ThreeFold Support Center (TSC), which allows us to support users of ThreeFold technology in a controlled and efficient manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    The TSC ticketing system is meant for all deployments and users of TF technology including TF Grid, software, and/or token-related issues.</p>
  <p>Want to log a support issue or contact us?
  </p>
  <p>
    Visit the ThreeFold Support Center, log in with your 3Bot, and click on ‘Submit a ticket.’ You can even follow the process of your ticket on this platform. Fast, easy, and safe.
